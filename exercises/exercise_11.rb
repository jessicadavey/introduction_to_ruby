# Ruby documentation sources:


# docs.ruby-lang.org and ruby-doc.org appear to be exactly the same, though I 
# guess I slightly prefer the font of the former.  This the documentation that
# I have been referencing while working through this book, so it's the most familiar
# to me, so far.


# So far I've done nothing with Ruby on Rails, but guides.rubyonrails.org
# looks like it could be a good reference.
